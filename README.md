# OneKey 28 Year Shift

This code is a sample implementation of the OneKey 28 Year Shift feature developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to shift historical trading data to the left for 28 years and analyze the shifted data to detect cheats within an EA (Expert Advisor). The code also calculates the performance of an EA based on the shifted data and evaluates its effectiveness before and after the shift.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary libraries and define the required constants.
2. Use the `ShiftDataLeftFor28Years` function to shift the data to the left for 28 years.
3. Use the `DetectCheats` function to analyze the shifted data and detect cheats within an EA.
4. Use the `CalculatePerformance` function to calculate the performance of an EA based on the shifted data.
5. Use the `EvaluateEAEffectiveness` function to evaluate the effectiveness of an EA by comparing its performance before and after the shift.
6. Use the `PresentEvaluationResults` function to present the evaluation results to traders.
7. Use the `HandleErrors` function to handle any errors that may occur during data shifting and analysis.
8. Call the `OnStart` function as the entry point of the program.

## Description

The OneKey 28 Year Shift feature allows traders to analyze the performance of an EA by shifting historical trading data to the left for 28 years. This code provides functions to shift the data, detect cheats within an EA, calculate its performance, and evaluate its effectiveness before and after the shift.

The `ShiftDataLeftFor28Years` function takes in an array of data and its size as parameters. It shifts the data to the left for 28 years by replacing the first `252 * 28` elements with the next `252 * 28` elements. The remaining elements are filled with 0.

The `DetectCheats` function analyzes the shifted data to detect cheats within an EA. It finds the maximum and minimum values in the data and calculates the data range. The cheat detection threshold is set to 10% of the data range. If any data point exceeds the threshold, cheats are detected.

The `CalculatePerformance` function calculates the performance of an EA based on the shifted data. It calculates the daily return for each data point and sums them up. The average return is then converted to an annualized percentage by multiplying it with `252 * 100`.

The `EvaluateEAEffectiveness` function evaluates the effectiveness of an EA by comparing its performance before and after the shift. It calls the `CalculatePerformance` function for the data before and after the shift and compares the performances. The evaluation result is returned as a string.

The `PresentEvaluationResults` function presents the evaluation results to traders by printing them to the console.

The `HandleErrors` function handles any errors that may occur during data shifting and analysis. If an error occurs, it prints an error message to the console.

The `OnStart` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the data arrays with sample historical trading data, performs the data shifting and analysis, and presents the evaluation results to traders.

## Product Description

The OneKey 28 Year Shift is a powerful feature that allows traders to analyze the performance of their EAs by shifting historical trading data to the left for 28 years. By detecting cheats within an EA and calculating its performance based on the shifted data, traders can evaluate the effectiveness of their EAs before and after the shift.

This code provides a sample implementation of the OneKey 28 Year Shift feature. It includes functions to shift the data, detect cheats within an EA, calculate its performance, and evaluate its effectiveness. Traders can use this code as a starting point to integrate the OneKey 28 Year Shift feature into their own trading systems.
